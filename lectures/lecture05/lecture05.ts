      In today's lecture we'll take a look at the basics of compound objects using \`struct\` definitions to create our own custom data types composed of several different members that may each have their own distinct type. These custom types allow us to model real-world objects and/or concepts and are also the foundation for building abstract data types (we'll learn more about this later).

      But first, let's take a detour to formally acknowledge the \`const\` keyeword, which has been showing up and will start showing up even more in the near future...

        The \`const\` keyword is a _type qualifier_ that we can add to declarations to tell the compiler that we don't intend for some value to change or be changeable. For it's part, the compiler then double checks for us that we don't accidentally try to do this and gives an error if we do!

      title: "`const` Conversions",
      mk_description: dedent`
        The compiler also needs to decide where implicit conversions involving \`const\` should be allowed. The motivating principle is that we should never leave the program "less safe" than it was before in terms of protecting \`const\` objects. Let's take a look at a few examples...

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <iframe class="lec-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXvWYNNWoCI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <br />

        Perhaps the most important place these rules are realized is in function call parameters. Following the rules above, the compiler will only allow a function to be called on a \`const\` object if the parameters also include the necessary \`const\` qualification to continue protecting that object. Essentially, only functions that "promise" not to change their parameters are allowed to be called on \`const\` objects/variables.

        The exercise below explores this idea...

        Now, back to our main event... defining and using compound objects.
        
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <iframe class="lec-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jY5AQytp2qI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <br />

        To recap the fundamentals:
        - We can define a new compound object _type_ via a **struct definition** (e.g. \`Person\`).
        - The \`struct\` definition contains **member variable declarations**. (e.g. what components does a \`Person\` have?)
        - We define objects as **instances** of that type and use them in the program.
        - Individual members are accessed via the \`.\` operator (also called the "**member access operator**").

        If you've got **a \`struct\` object that is const-qualified**, that forbids assignment to the struct as a whole and also forbids assignment to its individual members. That fits with the idea of \`const\` as "this shouldn't change".

        Finally, we can **work with structs via pointers**. If you're doing that, the syntax for member access changes. For example, assume \`obj\` is a \`Person\` object and \`ptr\` is a \`Person*\` pointer that points to that object. Then you would access the person's age as either:
        - \`obj.age\`
        - \`ptr->age\`

        Use the \`.\` for objects and the \`->\` for pointers.

        This is a good time to review the general best practices for parameter passing:
        - If you need to modify the original object, use **pass-by-pointer** or **pass-by-reference**.
        - If you don't modify the original object, use **pass-by-pointer-to-const** or **pass-by-reference-to-const**. This protects against accidental modification but more importantly also ensures your function can actually be called on const objects.
        - Only use **pass-by-value** for fundamental objects (e.g. \`int\`, \`double\`, etc.) or very small compound objects. If the objects are large (e.g. \`string\`, \`vector\`, your own custom \`struct\`s, etc.), pass-by-value makes an expensive and unnecessary copy.
