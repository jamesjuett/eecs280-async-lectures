I'll make sure to call out anything specific you need to know for the current term.\n\nWhere course content has changed or I figure out a better way to teach something, I'll also make sure to record updated videos. Sometimes I reuse a video and point out a few minor differences. Because course policies change slightly each term, this lecture has more cases of that than usual...\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-secondary\" role=\"alert\" markdown=\"1\">\n  <h5><span class=\"badge badge-success\">Fall 2024</span></h5>\n  We now have 6 projects instead of 5, but the workload is the same. We used to have a single project covering \"Binary Search Trees\" and a \"Piazza Classifier Application\". This term, we're splitting it into two pieces. Project 4 is now the \"Piazza Classifier\" half, and Project 5 is the \"Binary Search Trees\" half. We made this change because it aligns better with the flow of curriculum in the rest of the course and overall should make for a better student experience.\n\n  The application on the old project 4 has changed to implementing a text editor using a linked list, and it now sits at project 5. We made this change because it's a more interesting and well-motivated application of a linked list (which we'll cover later in the course) than previous versions of the project.\n  \n  <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img src=\"assets/projects.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\n  </div>\n</div>",

The short version - you're encouraged to use tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. to help you learn, but you aren't allowed to use them to do your work for you. The [full version](https://eecs280.org/syllabus.html#generative-ai-policy) in our syllabus is also worth a read.\n\nIn almost all cases in EECS 280, I highly recommend against using generative AI tools for writing ANY code, regardless of the amount.
