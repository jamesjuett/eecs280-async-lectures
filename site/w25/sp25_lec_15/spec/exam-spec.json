      "mk_description": "\nWhen we define a variable in C++, the lifetime of the corresponding object and the memory it uses at runtime are all managed automatically for us. This specifically applies for both global and local variables, although in different ways.\n\nTo start, consider the `Bird` class and code in `main()` below. `Bird` defines a custom constructor (`Bird()`) and destructor (`~Bird()`) that print out a message when they run. Recall that constructors and destructors are special functions that run at the start/end of an object's lifetime...that means thinking about when these functions run (and print their messages!) is a helpful exercise in thinking precisely about their lifetimes in our code.\n\nTake a moment to mentally trace through the code and predict what you think will be printed. You can use the simulation to check.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <iframe class=\"lobster-iframe\" style=\"height: 600px;\" src=\"assets/object_lifetimes.html\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<br />\n\nIn the video below, I'll walk through the example above and introduce **dynamic memory**, which allows direct control over object lifetimes.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <iframe class=\"lec-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t7pidvzGGoY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<br />\n\nTo recap:\n - **Global variables** correspond to objects with static storage duration - their lifetime that extends throughout the entire program.\n - **Local variables** correspond to objects with automatic storage duration - their lifetime is limited to the block (i.e. a set of `{` `}`) in which they are defined and are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope.\n - **Dynamically allocated objects** are stored in a separate section of memory called the **heap**. The lifetime of such objects is controlled directly by the `new` and `delete` expressions in the code we write (and not automatically managed).",

Use the `new` operator to **create** a dynamically allocated object on the heap.\n2. **Keep track of that object's address using a pointer**. The object isn't restricted to any scope and can be used throughout our program.\n3. Once we're finished with the object, give its address (i.e. the pointer we're using to track it) to the `delete` operator, which **destroys** the object and **frees its memory** to be used for something else.\n\nHere's the details:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <iframe class=\"lec-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3yre1os6dg0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<br />\n",
