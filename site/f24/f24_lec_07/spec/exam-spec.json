Sorry about that!\n  \n</div>\n<div markdown=1 class=\"alert alert-info\">\n\n  This lecture presents a sample program that implements a \"Pirate Treasure\" game using C-Style ADTs and many of the programming techniques we've seen in the course so far. We also cover several debugging strategies to track down bugs in the program.\n\n  This lecture is shorter than usual - the live lectures are running behind schedule (turns out we tried to pack to much into the first several lectures...) and may not present this material. It's officially considered optional, but you may find the debugging strategies particularly helpful to apply to your own projects. (You can still earn participation credit for this lecture by answering the question following the first section.)\n\n  I didn't get this lecture out as soon as I would have liked, so I've extended the participation deadline until Friday at 11:59pm.\n  \n  <div style=\"position: absolute; bottom: 5px; right: 10px; font-weight: bold;\">Updated Fall 2024</div>\n  \n</div>\n<style>\n  .lec-video {\n    width: 80%;\n    aspect-ratio: 16/9;\n  }\n\n  iframe.lobster-iframe {\n    border: none;\n    width: 80%;\n    height: 450px;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n  }\n\n</style>",
