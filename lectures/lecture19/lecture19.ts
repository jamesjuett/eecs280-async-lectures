Today, we'll look at a fundamentally new way of developing algorithms and writing code using **recursion**.

Recursion occurs when a function that calls itself. It's a bit hard to describe why this is useful until you get a feel for it, but here's two high level points that eventually resonate:

- Recursion offers a different approach to "repetition" in code without using loops. Perhaps surprisingly, this can be more intuitive for some problems.
- Recursion allows us to model the self-similar structure that naturally exists in many interesting problems and data structures.

        To start, let's take a look at the basic mechanism by which a function can call itself recursively and a quick example of where this is actually useful.

        Funny story... I recorded this video a couple years ago and in the background of that video you can clearly hear (e.g. @ 0:20) my son running around downstairs playing with this:

        <div style="text-align: center">
          <img src="assets/duck.png" style="width: 200px;">
        </div>

        Oh well, at least it's somewhat related to the duck exercise.

              We already know the value of $$ducks(0)$$ is $$5$$, because that's the number of ducklings we start with (i.e. "after 0 months").

              Write a recurrence relation for the number of ducks after $$n$$ months, $$ducks(n) = ~ ???$$. Your recurrence should depend on the value(s) of the two previous months, e.g. $$ducks(n-1)$$ and $$ducks(n-2)$$.

        Let's consider an example of using recursion to processing a data structure - reversing an array.
        
        We could do this iteratively with a loop, but what does it look like using recursion?

      title: "Tail Recursion",
      mk_description: dedent`

        It turns out that recursion can be less memory-efficient than iteration in some cases due to a proliferation of stack frames. Let's take a look at a strategy called **tail recursion** that allows the compiler to perform optimizations to eliminate the inefficiency (in some cases).

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <iframe class="lec-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioW9LOCr00o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <br />

        In some cases, like the tail-recursive \`reverse()\` implementation, there's a natural approach to solve the problem using tail recursion. In other cases, like for \`factorial()\`, a more deliberate approach is necessary, including additional work to "pass a computed result forward" rather than computing a result as the call stack unwinds. Here's an example of an alternate approach that involves an extra accumlator parameter to implement a tail-recursive \`factorial()\` function.
