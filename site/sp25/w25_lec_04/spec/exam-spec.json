Each function takes up a certain amount of memory that depends on how many local variables it may need to store, and this memory is allocated and freed as needed during the program.\n\nBecause of the way that functions call work (i.e. the called function has to finish and return before you can start back up in the original function), it's natural to use a stack to represent the memory frames for each function. Whichever function is called most recently is added to the top of the stack, and will always be removed before any other functions that were already on the stack (this is called the \"Last In First Out\" or \"LIFO\" property).\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <iframe class=\"lec-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jT077RVOUgk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<br />",

      "mk_description": "We can achieve an effect similar to pass-by-reference by using a pointer instead. Here's the basic idea - just like with pass-by-reference, we want to work with the original object (e.g. in a `main()` function) without making a copy when we pass it in as a parameter. So, instead of passing the original object, we pass its address as a pointer parameter. That parameter is technically copied (i.e. this is technically a pass-by-value), but who cares! A copy of an address will still get you back to the original object's location.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <iframe class=\"lec-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c8cDH9ioynw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<br />\n\nIt also turns out that the compiler offers pass-by-reference as feature of the C++ language, but it's ultimately turned into pass-by-pointer in the compiled machine code.

      "mk_description": "\nA regular pointer contains the address of some other object in your program, and will lead you to that object when you dereference it. But there are a few exceptional cases we should consider:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" markdown=\"1\">\n  <iframe class=\"lec-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwYQmXUgqbM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  <br />\n  (Please note a typo near the end of the video - the return type of `find_by_length()` should be `string *`, not `int *`.)\n</div>\n<br />\n\nTo recap:\n  - **Uninitialized pointers**: Just like with any other (primitive) variable, if you don't initialize a pointer, it's value is determined by memory junk. That means it's pointing randomly off into space.  \n\n  - **Null pointers**: Sometimes we want to definitively say \"this pointer isn't pointing to anything right now\", and the way to do that is point it at address `0`.\n\nSome more examples:\n\n```cpp\n\nint x = 3;\n\nint *ptr1 = &x; // Initialized with the address of x, this pointer points to x\n*ptr1 = 10;     // Follows ptr1 to x and sets x to 10\n\nint *ptr2;      // Uninitialized pointer, points at some random address (eeeewww)\n*ptr2 = 10;     // Follows ptr2 off to some random part of memory and slaps down a 10\n                // causing undefined behavior depending on how important that memory was\n\nint *ptr2 = nullptr; // Null pointer, \"not pointing at anything right now\"\n*ptr2 = 10;          // Tries to write a 10 to address 0 in memory, which will almost\n                     // certainly crash (easier to debug than undefined behavior though!)\n```\n\nWhile uninitialized pointers are pretty much always bad, it's useful to have a nullable pointer to represent something \"optional\". But, to safely use pointer that might be null, you need to check the pointer before dereferencing it. For example:\n\n```cpp\n\n// Assume we have a pointer called ptr that might be null\n\nif (ptr != nullptr) {\n  // If we get in here, it's safe to dereference and do something with *ptr\n}\n```\n\nYou can also shorten that up by replying on an implicit conversion from pointer types to `bool`- non-null pointers will convert to `true` and null pointers will convert to `false`. (Kind of like the way nonzero numbers convert to `true` and `0` converts to `false`, considering a null pointer contains address `0x0`.)\n\n```cpp\n\n// Assume we have a pointer called ptr that might be null\n\nif (ptr) {\n  // If we get in here, it's safe to dereference and do something with *ptr\n  // That's because ptr would only turn into true if it wasn't null\n}\n```",
