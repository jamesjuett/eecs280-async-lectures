This lecture covers **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**, which are a special kind of binary tree that maintains a sorting invariant on its elements. It combines the advantages of a sorted array (i.e. fast lookup with binary search) with the flexibility of a linked list (i.e. efficient insert/remove operations anywhere in the data structure).

BSTs are the foundation of "industry-strength" implementations of several application-oriented data structures, including sets and maps. We'll particularly focus on maps, since we haven't discussed them previously and they are a key part of project 5 in EECS 280.

        In essence, a binary search tree is a regular binary tree where each node's left subtree contains lower values and right subtree contains higher values. Let's take a look at some specifics as well as the reason this leads to efficient performance.

        We can work with binary search trees using a similar recursive approach to regular binary trees, except that we can make an informed decision about which subtree to explore based on the sorting invariant.

        It's also worth a bit of time to take a look at how a binary search tree could be realized as a C++ class, including some of the specifics for the implementation you'll work with in EECS 280 project 5.

        Now, let's turn to some useful data structures implemented via a binary search tree.
        First, we'll consider a BST-based set, which will outperform the other array-based implementations we've seen previously.

      title: "Building a Map on a BST",
      mk_description: dedent`
        In this video, we'll introduce the idea of a map as an associative container where we can store and retrieve *values* according to a particular *key*. Then we'll look at the fundamental approach we could use to implement a map with a BST.

        <div style="text-align: center;">

        </div>
        <br />
        
        We'll return back in a future lecture to some more details on the actual implementation of the map, including how we can sort entries (i.e. pairs of keys and values) in the underlying binary search tree appropriately (i.e. based only on the key, not the value).

      title: "Map Example + Miscellaneous",
      mk_description: dedent`
        I'd like to build up to an example of using a \`std::map<string,int>\` to count the number of times each individual word occurs in a string of text. Each word will act as a key into the map, associated with a value representing its frequency.
        
        But, before we get there, let me introduce a few miscellaneous C++ features that will make the code a bit more elegant.

        First, the \`auto\` keyword, which tells the compiler to deduce the type of a variable for us - this can be useful with types like iterators that are a pain to write out by hand.

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <iframe class="lec-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5fQKw69np0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <br />

        
        Next, *range-based for loops*, which allow convenient iteration over any container that supports an iterator interface.

        <div style="text-align: center;">

        </div>
        <br />

        Finally, back to the word-counting example...
