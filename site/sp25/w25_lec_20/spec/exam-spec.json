Instead of checking for odd numbers, we would check for even numbers with `*begin % 2 == 0`.\n\n  The idea of swapping the return statements seems viable at first glace, but on closer inspection, this doesn't change the function to check for evens instead of odds.

We generally try to avoid global variables. We'll see better options soon...\n\n  Option B doesn't work, because the implementation `any_of()` function would need to pass in this extra parameter, but that wouldn't make sense if it was used with other predicates that don't expect a random extra parameter.\n\n  Option C follows from option B, but is flawed for the same reason. A higher-order function like `any_of()` should simply take in a predicate that is self-contained and does not require juggling extra parameters.\n\n  If only we could create customized `greater()` functions as we needed them, plugging in the specific threshold value we want... see the next section for details!\n</details>"
