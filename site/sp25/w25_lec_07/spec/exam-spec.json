      "mk_description": "\nIn addition to writing new code from scratch, it's also valuable to practice reading through a new codebase, understanding the way it's organized, and figuring out how to change it.\n\nFor this section, first get your own copy of the code. It lives in a public repository at [https://github.com/jamesjuett/pirate-treasure](https://github.com/jamesjuett/pirate-treasure). From the terminal, you can create local clone of this repository in your EECS 280 folder. Run the commands indicated by the `$` below (don't type/copy the `$` itself).\n\n```console\n$ cd ~/eecs280\n$ pwd\n/home/jjuett/eecs280\n$ git clone https://github.com/jamesjuett/pirate-treasure.git\nCloning into 'pirate-treasure'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 157, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (157/157), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (98/98), done.\nremote: Total 157 (delta 94), reused 117 (delta 57), pack-reused 0 (from 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (157/157), 80.20 KiB | 1.15 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (94/94), done.\n```\n\n(Note that some of your output may be different, e.g. your username in the home directory.)\n\nThis command will create a new folder called `pirate-treasure`. If you're using VS Code, you can open it by running:\n\n```console\ncode pirate-treasure\n```\n\nYou're welcome to browse through the code as much as you like. The organization ends up similar to EECS 280 project 2 in many places, and there are some areas you might find helpful as examples. At a minimum, consider the exercise below.",

Either `place_items()` could be modified to avoid the borders, or additional parameters could be added so that an acceptable region for placing the items could be specified when it was called by `Game_init()`.\n\n  Part 2: In this case, the `Game` ADT would be responsible for keeping track of the number of lives, and the implementations of several functions in `Game.cpp` would need to change to initialize and update the lives, as well as to consider lives when determining if the game is over. The `Game.hpp` file would also need to contain changes to the `Game` struct definition to store the current number of lives and to add a public interface function so that other ADTs like `CommandUI` could check the current number of lives.\n</details>"
