In some cases this may be necessary. In others, it's stylistically preferrable to make an otherwise implicit conversion more obvious. Here's a few examples:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n  double value = 4.3;\n\n  // implicit conversion, too easy to miss\n  int x = value;\n\n  // C-style cast, avoid doing this\n  int x = (int)value;\n\n  // C++-style cast, this is preferred\n  int x = static_cast<int>(value);\n}\n```\n\nIn C++, the `static_cast` form is preferred because it involves stronger compiler checks to ensure the conversion makes sense.",
