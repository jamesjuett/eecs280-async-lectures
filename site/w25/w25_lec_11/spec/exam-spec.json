You could think of this as the entry into the second half of \"EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures\" (although we'll come back to some more programming techniques later).\n\n  Consider `std::vector`, which we've used extensively so far. How would we implement our own vector-like container? Given the operations we'd like (e.g. indexing, `push_back()`, etc.), how should the internal memory for each element be arranged? How do we ensure that performance doesn't degrade unacceptably as the number of elements in the vector increases? These are the kinds of questions we'll consider in the next several lectures.\n\n  For today, we'll consider one of the fundamental approaches to representing a sequential container in memory - to simply store elements next to each other in memory within a large, contiguous allocation. In C++, an **array** (not to be confused with `std::array` from the C++ standard library), provides a low-level abstraction over a sequence of objects stored within a larger block of memory. It's customary to work with arrays via pointers, including by using **pointer arithmetic** to compute addresses of individual elements, so we'll cover that too.\n  \n  <div style=\"position: absolute; bottom: 5px; right: 10px; font-weight: bold;\">Updated Winter 2025</div>\n</div>\n<style>\n  .lec-video {\n    width: 80%;\n    aspect-ratio: 16/9;\n  }\n\n  iframe.lobster-iframe {\n    border: none;\n    width: 80%;\n    height: 450px;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n  }\n\n</style>",

      "mk_description": "Because an array is essentially just a sequence of objects (one for each element in the array) that are laid out contiguously in memory, we can leverage pointers (i.e. addresses) to work with arrays. Here's one example, informally:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <iframe class=\"lec-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyEOyWsHAUc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<br />\n\nLet's recap the fundamental arithmetic operations with pointers. Assume `ptr1` and `ptr2` are pointers and that `x` is an integer.\n\n1. **Pointer Offset**. For example, `ptr1 + x`. This computes a new address, offset `x` \"spaces\" in memory past the original `ptr1`. The size of a \"space\" depends on the type that `ptr1` was pointing to.  \n\n2. **Pointer Difference**. For example, `ptr2 - ptr1`. This computes the number of spaces between the two addresses in memory.\n\nNote that in both cases, we don't have to worry about how many bytes are involved - the compiler takes care of that behind the scenes based on the pointer types. We can think about offsets and differences in terms of the sequences of whole objects in memory.\n\nFinally, and perhaps one of the biggest takeaways here, indexing in arrays with the `[]` operator is a *O(1) - constant time* operation, because it's equivalent to a single pointer offset operation followed by a single dereference operation. We can just compute the address of an element and effectively jump there, regardless of how large the array is.",

Or, put another way, if `ptr1` is pointing somewhere before `ptr2` in memory. The rest of the comparison operators (`>`, `<=`, `>=`) work analogously.\n\nIt's also worth noting the equality operators `==` and `!=` test whether two pointers are pointing to the same object (by checking if they hold the same address and are pointing to the same place).",

You might hear someone say that traversal by index is slower, but this is generally not true given that modern compilers can optimize both approaches into the same machine code. You should use the one that feels more natural to you or that matches the generally accepted pattern for the code you're writing. In most cases, that's probably traversal by index.\n\nHowever, we're taking a look at traversal by pointer now because:\n\n1. It's another interesting thing you can do with pointers.\n2. It is customarily used in certain contexts, like with C-style strings, which we'll look at in a future lecture.\n3. It's conceptually similar to traversal by *iterator*, which we'll learn about later on in the course.",

The compiler turns array parameters into pass-by-pointer behind the scenes. That gives us a pointer we can use to access the original array. This is similar to pass-by-reference, but technically different.\n\n2. Because of this, the only thing passed into an array function is a pointer to the first element. That means we have to pass the size of the original array as a separate parameter.",
